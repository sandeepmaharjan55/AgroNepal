<div class="question"> I'm interested in farming. Where do I start? </div>
<div class="answer1">Take a class </div><div class="answer">Educational institutions such as colleges and universities, some community colleges and vocational ag programs at high schools offer formal learning settings. It is not always necessary to be enrolled as a student to take a course. Non-profit farm education and support organizations provide many kinds of informative programs.</div>
<div class="answer1">Surf the internet. </div><div class="answer">Information on all aspects of sustainable and organic agriculture is abundant. Become proficient with computers and the internet ~ they’re an integral part of agribusiness today. Start-2-Farm and ATTRA Beginning Farmer are two examples.</div>
<div class="answer1">Join farming organizations.</div><div class="answer"> There are farmer organizations for most agricultural commodities and for many niche products as well. Connect with them for sources of information and to attend annual conferences and workshops.</div>
<div class="answer1">Talk to successful farmers.</div><div class="answer"> You should not expect free advice - pay for their time or offer some form of compensation (your labor, etc.). Schedule your request for times when the farmer is not as busy. Farmer mentorship programs which connect beginning farmers with experienced ones may be locally available in your area. 
Work on a farm. There is no substitute for hands on training and experience in this career. Check into apprenticeship programs with successful farms which you think you’d like to own. </div><br /><br />
<div class="question"> What should I grow?</div>
<div class="answer">Grow products that people will buy. Unless you are independently wealthy, if you require an income from your farming endeavor, your first step is to conduct some basic marketing research, take a good hard look at your target markets, and then decide what you will grow or produce. In today’s business climate the importance of marketing cannot be over-emphasized.</div>
